Pointers

-Whenever you make pointer variable in the class you have 
to use the new keyword to allocate memory address to it.



Virtual Destructor

-Virtural Destructor is used when you point toward the
object of derived class with base class pointer then
at the end of program the destructor of base class
is called only. And the object of derived class stayed in the 
memory. To call the destructor of derived class also we have to
make virtual destructor of base class.

}
